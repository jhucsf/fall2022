Welcome to the website for Computer Systems Fundamentals (Fall 2022)
at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>!

The course is about *computer systems* from the *programmer's
perspective*.  We'll be making a fairly deep dive into topics such
as data representation, memory, assembly language, CPU architecture,
networks, and concurrency.  By the end of the course you'll know a lot
about how modern computers really work and how to take advantage of
their advanced features.

All public information about the course (readings, assignments, etc.) will
be posted on this website.

Use the links above to navigate the site.  The [Syllabus](syllabus.html)
describes course policies. The [Schedule](schedule.html) is the schedule
of readings and exams.  The [Assignments](assignments.html) page has
links to the programming assignments and indicates when they are due.

  three milestones, due (respectively) Wed Oct 12, Mon Oct 24, and
  Mon Oct 31. Note that the requirements of MS1 are minimal: you just
  need to submit a program that compiles and runs, but there is no
  requirement to implement specific functionality.
* **Oct 2** — There was a mistake in the answer to question 1.d in the
  [Exam 1 review solutions](resources/exam1review-solutions.html).
  In the answer to the multiplication part of the question, the

  as 130), but the correct exponent is 2 (encoded as 129.)
  The solution has been corrected.
