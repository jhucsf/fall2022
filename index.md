Welcome to the website for Computer Systems Fundamentals (Fall 2022)
at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>!

The course is about *computer systems* from the *programmer's
perspective*.  We'll be making a fairly deep dive into topics such
as data representation, memory, assembly language, CPU architecture,
networks, and concurrency.  By the end of the course you'll know a lot
about how modern computers really work and how to take advantage of
their advanced features.

All public information about the course (readings, assignments, etc.) will
be posted on this website.
